This is a schoolproject that I'm developing in a team to a external customer.
The JavaDocs and the code overall is in finnish by a request from the customer.
For the development we are using Scrum framework, and we use Azure Devops for project management.

The customer wants a windows based scoreboard program to possibly replace the older system they
are using in Kataja basketball team's games at the moment.

For now, I've been working only on the making of the countdown timer, and all that is related
around it. Here is showcased only the parts of the program I've made myself, and I will update
the files as we continue the development.
