This is a schoolproject that I'm developing with a team of seven people, and it's made to an external customer.
The JavaDocs and the code overall is in finnish as requested by the customer.
For the development we are using Scrum framework, and Azure Devops for project management.

The customer wants a Windows-based scoreboard-program to possibly replace the older system they
are using in Kataja basketball's games at the moment. Customer wishes a more modern system, 
which would be more efficient and more simple to use.

I've been in charge of making of the countdown timer, and all the parts that are related
to it (timeouts, changing quarters etc.). 

Here is showcased only the parts of the program I've made myself, and I will update
the files as we continue the development.
